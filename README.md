You love your Todo demos. Now you have an API to throw in the mix like a
grown up.

Find it on heroku (for now) at [http://high-robot-9464.herokuapp.com/][u]

It's generally RESTful. Read [the api tests][api] to see how to use it
until I get a chance to document this properly.

If you want to contribute, put on your best hipster pants and enjoy the
coffeescript.

**NOTE:** all lists are deleted after a week.
